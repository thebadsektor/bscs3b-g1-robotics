<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project utilizes a kit provided by LAFVIN. This kit is called the 4WD Smart Robot Car V2, and is one of the few kits that they offer. This kit includes the following</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 Custom Arduino UNO R3</li>
  <li>1 Motor Drive Expansion Board</li>
  <li>1 Infrared Remote</li>
  <li>1 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)</li>
  <li>1 Servo Motor (SG90)</li>
  <li>1 Bluetooth Module</li>
  <li>2 IR Proximity Sensor Modules</li>
  <li>3 Line Tracking Sensor Modules</li>
  <li>4 Yellow DC Motors</li>
  <li>4 Tires</li>
  <li>2 Photoresistor Sensor Module</li>
  <li>1 Servo Holder</li>
  <li>1 Ultrasonic Sensor Module Holder</li>
  <li>1 USB Cable</li>
  <li>1 Battery Case</li>
  <li>1 Bottom Acrylic Layer</li>
  <li>1 Upper Acrylic Layer</li>
  <li>1 Adhesive Tape</li>
  <li>1 4pin XH2.54 to Female Dupont</li>
  <li>2 3pin XH2.54 to Female Dupont</li>
  <li>5 3pin Female to Female Dupont</li>
  <li>3 Cable Ties</li>
  <li>1 Set of Screws</li>
  <li>1 Screw Driver</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionalities</h2>
<p>The robot car provides 6 functionalities which can be controlled by either the IR remote or via bluetooth to an android application. The 6 functionalities are listed below</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ultrasonic Obstacle Avoidance - with the use of two IR Proximity Sensor Modules and the Ultrasonic Sensor in tandem with the Servo Motor, the robot car can navigate through obstacle automatically</li>
  <li>Follow Me Function - follows the user by also utillizing two IR Proximity Sensor Modules, Ultrasonic Sensor, and Servo Motor on the front of the car</li>
  <li>Line Tracking - this will make the robot car follow a line laid down on the ground. The line can be made by using the adhesive tape provided in the kit. The car can follow the lines with the help of the 3 Line Tracking Sensor Modules placed on the bottom acrylic</li>
  <li>Light Seeking - the car can be driven by if illuminated by a strong light. By using two Photoresistor Sensor Module, we can make it move forward or turn to the left or right</li>
  <li>IR Remote Controlled - with the provided remote, the robot car can perform basic navigation such as moving forward, backward, left, and right. It can also rotate to the left, rotate to the right, and stopping all movements with a push of a button</li>
  <li>Bluetooth Remote Controlled - unlike the IR Remote, the Bluetooth Remote has access to all the functionalities of the robot car. Therefore this is the main method of controlling the robot car</li>
</ol>
